\section{Meta-analysis of ecosystem experiments}

\subsection{Statistical analysis}
\label{sec:statisticalanalysis}

The natural logarithm of the response ratio of the means and its variance were calculated for each response variable, experiment, treatment, and sampling year, using information about the the number of repeated measurements (multiple experimental plots, multiple sampling dates per year). This was done using the function \texttt{escalc(measure="ROM", ...)} from the \{metafor\} R package \citep{viechtbauer_conducting_2010}. The standard error was calculated as $\text{SE} = \sqrt{\text{var}/N}$, where $N$ is the number of repeated measurements.

For CO$_2$ experiments, the response ratio was normalised with (divided by) the natural logarithm of the ratio of elevated over ambient CO$_2$ concentrations.

Data was then aggregated by experiment using the procedure based on \citet{borenstein_effect_2009}, implemented by the function \texttt{agg(method = "BHHR", ...)} from the \{MAd\} R package \citep{mad_r_package}, and assuming a correlation of within-study response ratios of 0.5.

Finally, the meta-analysis of responses across experiments was performed as a mixed-effects meta-regression model using experiment as the grouping variable for random factors, and fitted via the restricted maximum likelihood esimation. This is implemented using the function \texttt{rma.mv(method = "REML", ...)} from the \{metafor\} R package \citep{viechtbauer_conducting_2010}. The confidence intervals (edges of boxes in Fig. 3) of the meta-analytic mean response ratio (bold line inside boxes in Fig. 3) span 95\%. 


\subsection{Response to CO$2$, MESI data}

\subsubsection{Data selection}

Data were used from the Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database \citep{vansundert_when_2023}, obtained from GitHub (\url{https://github.com/MESI-organization/mesi-db}). For CO$_2$ experiments, we considered only data from Free Air CO$_2$ Enrichment (FACE) experiments and from open-top chamber experiments, from experiments that provided data from at least three years. For data generated in multi-factorial experiments, we used only data from the CO$_2$-only treatment (no interactions with other experimentally manipulated factors considered). Variables shown in this manuscript (Fig. 3, 4, and 6 in this study) were identified by the response variable name in the database according to Tab. \ref{tab:varnams_mesi}.

\subsection{Response to N-fertilisation, MESI and NutNet data}

\subsubsection{Data selection}

Data were used from the Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database \citep{vansundert_when_2023}, obtained from GitHub (\url{https://github.com/MESI-organization/mesi-db}). For variables belowground biomass (bgb, \texttt{Rootsgperm2} in NutNet), root mass fraction (rmf, \texttt{rootmassfraction} in NutNet), aboveground biomass (agb), and the root:shoot ratio (root\_shoot\_ratio), we combined MESI data with data from the meta-analysis of the NutNet experiments network by \citet{cleland_belowground_2019}. Aboveground biomass from NutNet data was calculated as (bgb/rmf) $-$ bgb. The root:shoot ratio from NutNet data was calculated as bgb/agb. 

For MESI data, only data from field experiments were used for which the N application rate was less or equal to 300 kg N ha$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. For data generated in multi-factorial experiments, we used only data from the N-fertilisation-only treatment (no interactions with other experimentally manipulated factors considered). Variables shown in this manuscript (Fig. 3, 4, and 6 in this study) were identified by the response variable name in the database according to Tab. \ref{tab:varnams_mesi}.
