\section{Analysis of modelled land C sink trends}

We evaluated the time series of the simulated and observations-based land C balance, its decadal mean for years 2011-2020 and long-term trend for years 1959-2020 from outputs of the Trends and Drivers of Terrestrial Sources and Sinks of Carbon Dioxide (TRENDY) version 8 model intercomparison \citep{sitch_trends_2024}. We downloaded the original file \texttt{Global\_Carbon\_Budget\_2021v1.0.xlsx} (\url{doi:10.18160/gcp-2021}) from the Global Carbon Budget 2021 website and exported the tabs `Terrestrial Sink' and `Global Carbon Budget' for further analysis. From the latter, we derived the land C sink as the budget residual as quantified by \citep{friedlingstein22essd}:
\begin{equation}
S_\text{Land} = (E_\text{FF} + E_\text{LUC}) - (G_\text{atm} + S_\text{ocean} + S_\text{cement}) \;,
\end{equation}
where $S_\text{Land}$ is the land sink (`Observations' in Fig. 1 of the main text), $E_\text{FF}$ are emission from fossil fuel combustion, $E_\text{LUC}$ are emissions from land use change, $G_\text{atm}$ is the atmospheric growth rate, $S_\text{ocean}$ is the ocean sink, and $S_\text{cement}$ is the C sink from cement carbonation. The land sink simulated by models was taken as the annual C flux numbers provided in the tab `Terrestrial Sink' of the original file. It was taken by \citep{friedlingstein22essd} as the global biome producitivity (net terrestrial C balance) from simulations (TRENDY S2) forced by observed CO$_2$ and climate and with constant pre-industrial land use. The identification of models into C-only and C-N coupled models was done based on information provided in Table A.1 in \citep{friedlingstein22essd}.
