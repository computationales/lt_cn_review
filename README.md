Analyses of the review paper on C-N modelling by the LEMONTREE N cycle WG.

## Paper outline 

... and what analysis fits in where

### Global carbon cycle and vegetation changes

- TRENDY C sink trend analysis (analysis code file to be added here, -> Beni)

### Experiments and field data insights

`analysis_leafn_vcmax_field.Rmd`

- Field leaf N and Vcmax vs global map-based soil C:N using Ning Dong's dataset. Implemented in 
- Data aggregated to PFTs and comparison to P-model estimates and to veg model prescribed values (STILL MISSING, -> Ning, could you add code to his file?)
- Field leaf N and Vcmax vs global *measured* soil C:N, TROBIT data analysis: STILL MISSING  (-> Yunke)
- Ellsworth data analysis not possible due to missing longitude and latitude information.

`analysis_nfert_liang.Rmd`

- STILL MISSING
- Analysing effect size magnitudes in N fertilisation experiments: Nmass > Narea (> PNUE) > Vcmax. Separate control on LMA, influential for Nmass. (-> Evan)

`analysis_mesi.Rmd`

- (analysis code file to be added here, -> Beni)
- Allocation shift towards more belowground C allocation with consequence of stimulated soil decomposition and N uptake
- N fert triggers opposite?
- warming: decreasing Vcmax25 (although net mineralisation should be enhanced → not supply-driven)
- light: increasing Vcmax (although NPP and Nuptake should be enhanced → not dilution-driven)


### Confronting alternative models with observational benchmarks

### Long-term dynamics of N limitation

- Analysis to be added -> Beni, Pascal
