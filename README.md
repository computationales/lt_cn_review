Analyses of the review paper on C-N modelling by the LEMONTREE N cycle WG.

## Paper outline and what analysis fits in where

### Global carbon cycle and vegetation changes

- TRENDY C sink trend analysis (analysis code file to be added here, -> Beni)

### Experiments and field data insights

#### `analysis_leafn_ning_dong.Rmd`

- Field leaf N and Vcmax vs global map-based soil C:N using Ning Dong's dataset. Implemented in 
- Data aggregated to PFTs and comparison to P-model estimates and to veg model prescribed values

#### `analysis_leafn_trobit.Rmd`

- STILL MISSING
- Field leaf N and Vcmax vs global *measured* soil C:N (-> Yunke)

#### `analysis_nfert_liang.Rmd`

- STILL MISSING
- Analysing effect size magnitudes in N fertilisation experiments: Nmass > Narea (> PNUE) > Vcmax. Separate control on LMA, influential for Nmass. (-> Evan)

#### `analysis_mesi.Rmd`

- (analysis code file to be added here, -> Beni)
- Allocation shift towards more belowground C allocation with consequence of stimulated soil decomposition and N uptake
- N fert triggers opposite?
- warming: decreasing Vcmax25 (although net mineralisation should be enhanced → not supply-driven)
- light: increasing Vcmax (although NPP and Nuptake should be enhanced → not dilution-driven)


### Current and next-generation modelling paradigms
